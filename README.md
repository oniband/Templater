# Templater
A program that makes starting new projects with annoying startups easier. Configured in a single json file from .config/templater.
The only real reason for this project to exist is that I want to learn more C++ but setting up new openGL projects annoys me.

This could absolutely be a bash script but I just want an excuse to program something.
